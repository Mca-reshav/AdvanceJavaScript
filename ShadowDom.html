        //Shadow DOM:  it is a hidden dom inside our actual dom whenever we load the page, it doesnot get affected by the design or styling done at actual dom 

        //it is needed when we are working with multiple css library or even our own written css then a problem arises that classes of css may get matched with similar one and it will impact the styling by overwriting 

        // it allows you to hide some css part to get effected with another css styling
        
        // in the above example you can see that the original color get overwritten by the newer one

        //to check shadow dom we have used a range input, as we see on the output we will find that the styling of range input is already done like color, shadow, without describing it 

        // visit: browser setting >> preference>> elements >> show user agent shadow dom>> check it then go to elements section
