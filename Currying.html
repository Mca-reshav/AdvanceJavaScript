  //Currying is a powerful concept that allows you to break down functions into smaller, reusable units. It's especially useful for handling configuration, reducing redundancy, and building more declarative logic in your code.
  //You can apply currying to a wide variety of tasks such as logging, validation, API requests, price calculations, and more

    }
