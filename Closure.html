        //Closure in JavaScript is a form of lexical scoping used to preserve variables from the outer scope of a function in the inner scope of a function. Lexical scoping is the process used to define the scope of a variable by its position in the source code

        // a function with lexical scope is called as closures

        function outer(){
            
           return function test(){
                let a=100;
                return function inner(){
                    return a;
                }
            }
        }
        let test=outer();
        let inner=test();

        console.log(inner());
        console.dir(inner) // closure remember the value of a whne we are return a function but not in case when we are using directly
        //console.log(a)
